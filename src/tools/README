This directory contains two programs useful for administering the
directory. cert2ldap allows to put a certificate in the directory
with the right definitions. certfind performs the same search algorithm
as the Apache module to find the user based on the certificate.

The three scripts adduser, addgroup and addcertmap show how to
correctly define a user, group and certificate map node for use
with mod_authz_ldap.
