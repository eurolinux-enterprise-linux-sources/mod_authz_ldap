LDAP
----

This directory contains example LDAP data and matching schema definitions.
The file authzldap.schema contains the schema definition in standard
format, while authzldap.slapd.conf uses the old OpenLDAP 1 or University
of Michigan LDAP format. (the latter is no longer maintained or supported,
and is here only for historical reasons).

I use the data in this directory for testing, saying `make ldap' in this
directory starts an OpenLDAP server (provided it is installed in
/usr/local/libexec, I really don't want to make this dynamic via
autoconf) on port 33389. The server uses the slapd.conf file generated
by the configure script.

If you are using OpenLDAP, make sure that you include core.schema,
cosine.schema and nis.schema before including authzldap.schema, as
authzldap.schema uses definitions from all of them.
