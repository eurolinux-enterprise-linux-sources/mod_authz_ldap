This release incorporates the following changes:

Previously we used two directives to tell the module what to do, namely
the AuthzLDAPEngine command to tell to start working, and a separate
command to tell it how to authenticate. These commands have been merged
into a single AutzhLDAPMethod, see the docs for legal arguments. Without
AuthzLDAPMethod, the module does nothing, just as it did previously when
AuthzLDAPEngine was not specified.

This causes the HOWTO to be slightly outdated, but I hope you will still
find it helpful.
